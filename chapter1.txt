It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
first of all initialize git by command git init then ls -a to check the hidden files in directory.

In order to keep track changes of my files i need to add the file in a place called staging area

which is basically a place where we can choose which files  from directory should be committed.

git status to check which files are currently in staging area

git add file_name to add the file in staging area

git commit -m "message" to commit the file in local repository -m means adding message.

git log to see what i just committed

Now let's suppose i have made some changes in one of my files name chapter1.txt which i don't wanted so first let's check git status it will tell me that file chapter1.txt is modified

git diff chapter1.txt show me the comparison between the previous and current content

git checkout chapter1.txt will revert back the work i done to previous one

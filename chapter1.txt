It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
first of all initialize git by command git init then ls -a to check the hidden files in directory.

In order to keep track changes of my files i need to add the file in a place called staging area

which is basically a place where we can choose which files  from directory should be committed.

git status to check which files are currently in staging area

git add file_name to add the file in staging area

git commit -m "message" to commit the file in local repository -m means adding message.

git log to see what i just committed

Now let's suppose i have made some changes in one of my files name chapter1.txt which i don't wanted so first let's check git status it will tell me that file chapter1.txt is modified

git diff chapter1.txt show me the comparison between the previous and current content

git checkout chapter1.txt will revert back the work i done to previous one

first of all we have a 
1. working directory : where all of my files are available
2. staging area : which is a place where we add some files using ( git add file_name ) and choose which file to be added in repo or not
3. loacl repository : a repo we create locally in our computer
         first go to github then create a new repo name it set it to public then we get some commands there is a command for pushing in existing repo there we have a url
         so in our terminal first put command ( git remote add origin our_url )  
         then ( git push -u origin main ) now our code is pushed to our remote repository
4. remote repository : which is our github
         in git staging area after few commits we have a timeline of our commits which are called Main Branch

         like we do some commits like commit 1, commit 2, and so on then we have Branch of commit in local repo when we use git push command then all these commit are passed to remoter repo
